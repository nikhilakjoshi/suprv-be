## COMPLETED: Prompt Refinement for Gemini 2.5 Flash

### Issues Identified:
- Time stamps: Model generating inaccurate or placeholder timestamps
- Utterance breaking: Doesn't segment speech naturally, creates artificial breaks

### Solutions Implemented:

1. **Enhanced Timestamp Instructions**:
   - Explicit MM:SS format requirements
   - Sequential validation rules
   - Prohibition of placeholder timestamps
   - Overlap prevention mechanisms

2. **Improved Utterance Segmentation**:
   - Natural conversation turn detection
   - Rules for when to create new utterances
   - Prevention of mid-sentence breaks
   - Context-aware segmentation

3. **Model-Specific Optimizations**:
   - Tailored instructions for Gemini 2.5 Flash behavior patterns
   - JSON validation emphasis
   - Validation checklist for quality assurance

### Files Updated:
- `/mock_llm_transcription.py` - Updated with refined system prompt
- `/prompts/refined_transcription_prompt.md` - Comprehensive documentation of improvements

### Next Steps:
- Test refined prompt with actual Gemini 2.5 Flash model
- Validate improvements in timestamp accuracy and utterance segmentation
- Fine-tune based on real-world performance
