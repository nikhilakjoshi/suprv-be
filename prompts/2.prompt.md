Create a new directory named `langgraph_run` and put all files relevant to this new requirement int that directory. I need to be able to lift and shift this directory to another project easily.
We need to create a langgraph execution that for a given audio file,

1. Transcribes the audio
2. Creates a summary of the transcription
3. Performs sentiment analysis on the transcription
4. Executes `RegBI`, `RegDD`, `MIRANDA` and `Elderly Abuse` compliance checks on the transcription.
5. Generates a final json output containing the transcription, summary, sentiment analysis results, and compliance check results.

Make sure to use the vertex ai framework for the implementation.
In fact ensure that the clients are swappable to other frameworks. So have the client in a separate file.
